<h3>HOME INDUSTRIES AND DOMESTIC
MANUFACTURES.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap"><big>T</big>he</span> subject of Home Industries is beginning
to attract the attention of those
who are interested in political economy
and the general welfare of the country,
and thoughtful people are asking themselves
why, in all the length and breadth
of America, there are no well-established
and prosperous domestic manufactures.</p>

<p>We have no articles of use or luxury
made in <i>homes</i> which are objects of commercial
interchange or sources of family
profit. To this general statement there
are but few exceptions, and curiously
enough these are, for the most part, in
the work of our native Indians.</p>

<p>A stranger in America, wishing&mdash;after
the manner of travelers&mdash;to carry back
something characteristic of the country,
generally buys what we call &#8220;Indian
curiosities&#8221;&mdash;moccasins, baskets, feather-work,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
and the one admirable and well-established
product of Indian manufacture,
the Navajo blanket. But these hardly
represent the mass of our people.</p>

<p>We may add to the list of Indian industries,
lace making, which is being successfully
taught at some of the reservations,
but as it is not as yet even a self-supporting
industry, the above-named
&#8220;curiosities&#8221; and the Navajo blanket
stand alone as characteristic hand-work
produced by native races; while from our
own, or that of the co-existent Afro-American,
we have nothing to show in
the way of true domestic manufactures.</p>

<p>When we contrast this want of production
with the immense home product of
Europe, Asia, parts of Africa, and South
America&mdash;and even certain islands of the
Southern Seas&mdash;we cannot help feeling a
sort of dismay at the contrast; and it is
only by a careful study of the conditions
which have made the difference that we
become reassured. It is, in fact, our very
prosperity, the exceptionally favourable
circumstances which are a part of farming
life in this country, which has hitherto
diverted efforts into other channels.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>These conditions did not exist during
the early days of America, and we know
that while there was little commercial exchange
of home commodities, many of the
arts which are used to such profitable purpose
abroad existed in this country and
served greatly to modify home expenses
and increase home comforts. To account
for the cessation of these household
industries, it is only necessary to notice
the drift of certain periods in the short
history of America&#8217;s settlement and development.</p>

<p>We shall see that the decline of domestic
manufactures in New England and the
Middle States was coincident with two
rapidly increasing movements, one of
which was the opening and settlement
of the great West, and the other the establishment
of cotton and woolen mills
throughout the country.</p>

<p>In short, the abundant acreage of Western
lands, fertile beyond the dreams of
New England or Old World tillers, threw
the entire business of production or family
support upon the man. The profit of his
easily acquired farm land was so great
and certain that it became almost a reproach<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
to him to have his womenkind
busy themselves with other than necessary
household duties.</p>

<p>The cotton and woolen mills stood
ready to supply the needed material for
clothing, and it was positive economy to
push the spinning-wheel out of sight under
the garret eaves and chop up the bulky
loom for firewood. The wife and daughters
might reputably cook and clean for the
men whose business it was to cover the
black acres with golden wheat, but spinning
and weaving were decidedly unfashionable
occupations. Even the emigrants from
countries where the spinning and weaving
habit was an inheritance as well as a necessity,
were governed by the custom of the
country, and devoted the entire energy
of the family to the raising of crops.</p>

<p>It is, in fact, owing to fortunate circumstances
that, if we except the mountain
regions of the South, there are no
longer farmhouse or domestic manufactures
in America.</p>

<p>This, as I have said, only goes to prove
the hitherto unexampled prosperity of the
country. In fact, the absence of these
very industries means that there are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
greater sources of profit within the reach
of farming households.</p>

<p>This being so, it is natural to ask, why
the re-establishment of farmhouse manufactures,
or the encouragement and development
of them, is a desirable movement.</p>

<p>There are exceedingly good individual
and personal reasons; and there are also
commercial and national ones, which
should not be ignored.</p>

<p>All farmers are not successful. There
are many poor as well as rich ones; and
the wife of a poor farmer has less pecuniary
independence, less money to spend, and
fewer ways of gaining it, than any other
woman of equal education and character
in America.</p>

<p>A poor farmer is often obliged to pay
out for labour, fencing, stock, insurance
and taxes every dollar gained by the
sale of his crops, and if by good luck or
good management there should be a small
excess, he is apt to hoard it against unlooked-for
emergencies. This, at first enforced
economy, grows to be the habit of
his life, so that even if he becomes well-to-do,
or even rich, he distrusts exceedingly
the wisdom of any expenditure save his own.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>A mechanic, or a man in any small line
of business, must trust his wife with the
disbursement of a certain part of the
family income. It passes through her
hands in the way of housekeeping, and
the management of it exercises and develops
her faculties; but the wife of the
farmer has no such interest. The farm is
expected to supply the family living, and
this blessed fact becomes almost a curse
when it deprives the wife of the mental
stimulus incident to the management of
resources.</p>

<p>Added to this there is often, at least
through the winter, partial or complete
isolation from neighbourly or public interests.
The great crops of the country
are produced under circumstances which
necessitate distance from even the most
limited social centres, and that the farmer&#8217;s
wife suffers from this we know, not only
from observation, but from the statistics of
insane asylums. And here I am tempted
to quote from a letter of a close student of
farmhouse life in the West. She writes:</p>

<p>&#8220;That the farmer himself, as isolated
and hard worked, makes no such record, I
believe due to the mental tonic, the broadening<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
influence that comes from a sense of
responsibility in life&#8217;s larger affairs. The
woman works like a machine, irresponsible
as to final results; the man like a thinking,
planning, responsible, independent human
being.&#8221;</p>

<p>This seems to me a very fair statement
of the case. The woman, who misses
social companionship, and who has not the
saving influence of administration and
responsibility even in her own household,
is narrowed to a very small point in life&#8217;s
affairs, and it is inevitable that she should
suffer from it. The variety of her work
also has dwindled. Cooking and house-cleaning
follow each other in monotonous
routine, with too much of it at planting
and harvest seasons and too little at others.
She has not even the pleasure of comparison
and emulation in her daily work; it
neither exercises her faculties nor stimulates
her thought.</p>

<p>During the winter months she has abundant
leisure for a harvest of her own, in
some interesting manufacture adapted to
her education and circumstances, and in
the prosecution of these she would be
brought into a bond of common interest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
with other women. So far I have spoken
only of the individual and personal reasons
for which certain domestic and artistic
industries well might be encouraged; but
the public and economic reasons are easy
to find.</p>

<p>In looking at the variety and bulk of
our national imports, we may be surprised
to see how large a proportion of them are
of domestic origin. In fact, nearly everything
which comes under the head of artistic
products is the result of domestic
industry. The beauty and simplicity of
many of these things is surprising, and
yet they have required neither unusual
talent or careful training. They are simply
the result of the <i>habit</i> of production,
and their value is in the personal expression
we find in them. They have always
this advantage over mechanical manufacture,
and can be safely relied upon to find
a market in the face of close mechanical
imitation.</p>

<p>Among these domestic products we
shall find the laces of all countries, Ireland,
Belgium, France, Italy, Sweden and
Russia contributing this beautiful manufacture,
from finest to coarsest quality. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
is as common a process as knitting in the
homes of many countries, and the fact of
it being successfully taught in the Indian
cabins of the far West proves that it is
not a difficult accomplishment. Embroideries,
in all countries but our own, are
common and profitable home productions;
and when we come to hand-weavings the
variety is infinite. In practical England,
the value of hand-weavings in linens has
led to the introduction of small &#8220;parlour
looms&#8221; from Sweden; and damasks of special
designs are woven for special customers
who appreciate their charm and worth.</p>

<p>Of all hand processes, weaving is the
most generally or widely applicable, and
the range of beautiful production possible
to the simplest weaving is almost beyond
calculation.</p>

<p>Many of the costly Eastern rugs are as
simply woven as a Navajo blanket, or even
a rag carpet. The process is in many
cases almost identical, the variation being
only in closeness or fineness of warp and
arrangement of colour.</p>

<p>I have been much interested of late in
an application of art to a local industry
in New Hampshire. It is one which seems<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
to prevail to a greater or less degree all
through New England, and the product is
called &#8220;pulled rugs.&#8221; The process consists
of drawing finely cut rags through
some loose, strong cloth, mainly bagging
or burlap. I have seen these rugs at Bar
Harbor and along the Massachusetts coast
for many years, and while they possessed
the merit of durability, they were, for the
most part, so ugly and unattractive that
only the most sympathetic personal interest
in the maker would induce one to
purchase them. The change that has
been wrought in this manufacture by an
intelligent application of art is really marvelous.
The product came under the
attention of a woman trained in that valuable
school, &#8220;The Institute of Artist Artisans.&#8221;
She tried the experiment of using
new material carefully dyed to follow certain
Oriental designs, and the result is a
smooth, velvety, thick-piled rug, which
cannot be distinguished from a fine Oriental
rug of the same pattern. The cost of this
manufacture is necessarily considerable,
since the process is slow and the material
costly. But in spite of these disadvantages,
the drawn rugs have met with deserved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
favour, and are a source of profitable
labour to the community. It is undoubtedly
the beginning of an important
industry, which owes its success entirely
to the art education of one woman.</p>

<p>There is an improvement somewhat
akin to this in the weaving of rag-carpet
rugs, and this is not confined to one locality.
It consists in the use of <i>new</i> rags, carefully
selected as to colour both of rags and warp,
and the result is surprisingly good.</p>

<p>One might say that we have in this
country peculiar advantages for positive
artistic excellence as well as volume of production.
We grow our own wool and cotton.
We have a great and growing population,
with such application of mechanical
invention to routine and necessary work
as greatly to reduce household labour.
Added to this, there has been during the
last ten years so much and such general
art study as to have created a sort of diffused
love of art manufactures, so that
many of the people who would naturally
adopt the work would have an instructive
judgment regarding it. I should not
be afraid to predict great and even peculiar
excellence in any domestic manufacture<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
which became the habit of any given
locality.</p>

<p><i>The subject of our domestic industries
is one which should fall naturally within
the objects of women&#8217;s clubs.</i> If every
woman&#8217;s club in the country chose from
its members those who by artistic instinct
or education, and the possession of practical
ability, were fitted to lead in the work,
and made of them a committee on home
industries, the reports from it would soon
become a matter of absorbing interest
to the club, and the productions made
under the protection, so to speak, of the
club, would have an advantage that any
commercial business would consider invaluable.
Neither would the advantage
be limited by the interest of a single club.
That great social engine, &#8220;The Federation
of Women&#8217;s Clubs,&#8221; can wield an almost
magical power in the creation of interests
or encouragement of effort, and the federation
of organizations, each one exchanging
experiences as well as products, would be
an ideal means of growth and extension.</p>

<p>The machinery for the work exists in
almost every county of every State of the
Union, and with the threefold interest of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the promotion of practical art, that of increased
manufacture, and the extension of
that sisterhood which is one of the most
Christian-like and desirable aims of women&#8217;s
clubs, it would seem a natural and
congenial effort.</p>

<p>The best results of this general awakening
will probably be in the South. Certainly
no conditions could be more favourable
than those existing in the Cumberland
Mountains, where wool and cotton grown
upon the rough farms are habitually spun
and woven and dyed in the home cabin.
The dyes are often made from walnut bark,
pokeberry, and certain nuts and roots
which have been found capable of &#8220;fast&#8221;
stain and are easily procured. Unfortunately,
the facility with which aniline dyes
can be used is not unknown. The &#8220;linsey
woolsey,&#8221; which is not only a common
manufacture in the farmhouses, but the
common wear of both men and women, is
an interesting and good manufacture,
capable of much wider use than it enjoys
at present.</p>

<p>And linsey woolsey is not the only home
weaving done in the Cumberland Mountains.
The showing of cotton homespun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
towel weaving at the Atlanta Exposition
was a feature of the Exposition, and the
homespun blankets of the various kinds
which one finds in common use are only a
step removed from the process of the
admirable Navajo blanket.</p>

<p>We see from these different possibilities
and indications, that although we are still
a people without true home productions,
there is every reason to believe that this
condition will not be a lasting one, and that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
before many years we shall find the special
advantages and general cultivation of the

<h3>RUG WEAVING.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap"><big>R</big>ag</span> carpets have been made and used
in farmhouses for many generations, but
it is only of late that there has been a general
demand in all country houses for
home-made piazza rugs, bedroom rugs,
and rugs for general use.</p>

<p>It has been found that the best and
most durable rugs for these purposes, and
for bath-rooms for town and city houses,
can be made of cotton or woolen rags sewed
and woven in the regular old-fashioned
rag-carpet way, the difference being&mdash;and
it is rather a large difference&mdash;that the
rags must be new instead of old, and that
the colors must be good and carefully
chosen instead of being used indiscriminately,
and in addition to this it must be
woven in two-yard lengths, with a border
and fringe at either end. This being done,
good, attractive and salable rugs can be
made of almost any color, and suitable for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
many purposes. It is an industry perfectly
adapted to farmhouse conditions,
and if well followed out would make a
regular income for the women of the
family.</p>

<p>The cumbrous old wooden loom is still
doing a certain amount of work in nearly
every country neighbourhood, and it is
capable of a greatly enlarged and much
more profitable practice. I find very
little if any difference in the rugs woven
upon these and the modern steel loom. It
is true that the work is lighter and weaving
goes faster upon the latter, and where
a person or family makes an occupation
of weaving it is probably better to have
the latest improvements; but it is possible
to begin and to make a success of rag rug
weaving upon an old-fashioned loom, and
as a rule old-fashioned weavers have little
to learn in new methods.</p>

<p>This small book is intended as a help in
adapting their work to modern demands,
as well as to open a new field to the
farmer&#8217;s family during the winter months,
when their time is not necessarily occupied
with growing and securing crops.</p>

<p class="caption">WEAVING</p>

<p>It does not undertake to teach any one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
who buys or has inherited a loom to begin
weaving without any further preparation.
The warping or threading of it must be
<i>seen</i> to be understood, but when that is
once learned, all of the rest is a matter of
practice and experiment, and is really no
more difficult than any other domestic art.
One would not expect to spin without
being shown how to pull the wool and
turn the wheel at the same time, or even to
sew or knit without some sort of instruction,
and the same is true of weaving.</p>

<p>There are many old looms still to be
found in the garrets of farmhouses, and
where one has been inherited it is best to
begin learning to weave upon it instead
of substituting a new one, since the same
knowledge answers for both. Probably
some older member of the family, or at
least some old neighbour, will be able to
teach the new beginner how to set up the
loom and to proceed from that to actual
weaving. After this is learned it rests with
one&#8217;s self to become a good weaver, a
practical dyer, and to put colors together
which are both harmonious and effective.</p>

<p>What I have chiefly tried to show is how
to get proper materials and how to use<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
them to the best advantage. I think it is
safe to say that no domestic art is capable
of such important results from a pecuniary
point of view, or so important an extension
in the direction of practical art. Where
it is used as an art-process and an interesting
occupation, by women of leisure,
it is capable of the finest results, and there
is no reason why these results should not
become a matter of business profit.</p>

<p>Rag carpets have generally been woven
of rags cut from any old garments cast
aside by the household&mdash;coats and trousers
too old for patching, sheets and pillow-cases
too tender to use, calico, serge, bits
of woolen stuffs old and new, went into
the carpet basket, to be cut or torn into
strips, sewed indiscriminately together,
and rolled into balls until there should be
enough of them for the work of the loom.
When this time came the loom would be
warped with white cotton or purple yarn,
dyed with &#8220;sugar paper&#8221; or logwood, and
the carpet woven. Even with this entire
carelessness as to any other result than
that of a useful floor covering, the rag
carpet, with its &#8220;hit or miss&#8221; mixture,
was not a bad thing; and a very small<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
degree of attention has served to give it
a respectable place in domestic manufactures.
But it is capable of being
carried much farther; in fact, I know of
no process which can so easily be made
to produce really good and beautiful
results as rag carpet weaving.</p>

<p>The first material needed is what are
called carpet warps, and these can be purchased
in different weights and sizes and
more or less reliable colours in every
country store, this fact alone showing
the prevalence of home weaving, since
the yarns are not&mdash;at least to my knowledge&mdash;used
for any other purpose.</p>

<p>The cost of warp, dyed or undyed,
depends upon the quantity required,
or, in other words, upon its being purchased
at wholesale or retail. At retail
it costs twenty cents per pound, and at
wholesale sixteen. To buy of a wholesale
dealer one must be able to order at
least a hundred pounds, and as this would
weave but a hundred and fifty rugs it
would not be too large a quantity to have
on hand for even a moderate amount of
weaving. These prices refer only to ordinary
cotton warps, and not to fine &#8220;silk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
finish,&#8221; to linen, or even to silk ones, each
of which has its special use and price.</p>

<p>In all of them fast colour is a most
desirable quality, and, indeed, for truly
good work a necessity. I have found but
two of the colours which are upon ordinary
sale to be reasonably fast, and those are a
very deep red and the ordinary orange.
The latter will run when dipped in water;
in fact, it will give out dye to such good
purpose that I have sometimes used the
water in which it has been steeped to dye
cotton rags, as it gives a very good and
quite fast lemon yellow.</p>

<p>It follows, then, that in weaving rugs
(which must be washable) with orange
warp, the warp must be steeped in warm
water before using. It can be used in that
state, or it can be <i>set</i> with alum, or it can
be dipped in a thin indigo dye and made
into a good and fast green.</p>

<p>The only recourse of the domestic weaver
who wishes to establish her rugs as of the
very best make is to dye her own warps;
and this is not only an easy but a most interesting
process; so much so, in fact, that
I am tempted to enlarge upon it as a practical
study for the young people of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
family. It is necessary at the very beginning
to put much stress upon the value
of fast colour in the warping yarn, since a
faded warp will entirely neutralize the
colour of the rags, and spoil the beauty of
the most successful rug.</p>

<p>The most necessary and widely applicable
colour needed in warps, or, indeed,
in rags, is a perfectly fast blue in different
depths, and this can only be secured by
indigo. Aniline blue in cotton is never
sun-fast and rarely will stand washing,
but a good indigo blue will neither run or
fade, and is therefore precisely what is
needed for domestic manufacture. Fortunately,
the dye-tub has been, in the past
at least, a close companion of the loom,
and most old-fashioned farmers&#8217; wives
know how to use it. With this one can
command reliable blue warps of all shades;
and when we come to directions for making
washable rugs its importance will be seen.</p>

<p>As I have said, by dipping orange warp
in medium indigo blue a fast and vivid
green can be secured, and these two tints,
together with orange and red, give as many
colours as one needs for rug weaving; they
give, in fact, a choice of five colours&mdash;orange,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
red, blue, green and white.
Orange and red are both colours which
can be relied upon when prepared from
the ordinary &#8220;Magic&#8221; dyes of commerce.
Turkey red especially is safe to last, even
when applied to cotton. In the general
disapproval of mineral dyes, this one may
certainly be excepted, as well as the crimson
red known as &#8220;cardinal,&#8221; which is
both durable and beautiful, in silk or
woolen fibre or texture.</p>

<p>After good warps are secured, the second
material needed is <i>filling</i>; and here the
subject of old and new rags is to be considered.
Of course, cloth which has served
other purposes, as in sheets, pillow-cases,
curtains, dress skirts, etc., is still capable
of prolonged wear when the thin parts are
removed and those which are fairly strong
are folded and bunched into carpet filling;
and for family use, or limited sale, such
rags&mdash;dyed in some colour&mdash;are really
desirable. Good varieties of washable
rugs can be made of half-worn cotton
without dyeing (although they will not
be as durable as if made from unworn
muslin) by using blue warps to white fillings.
The colour effects and methods of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
weaving will be the same whether old or
new rags are used; but in making a study
of rag rug weaving from the point of view
of building up an important industry, it is
necessary to consider only the use of new
rags and how to procure the best of them
at the cheapest rates.</p>

<p>There is a certain amount of what is
called waste in all cloth mills, either cotton,
wool or silk, and also in the manufacture
of every kind of clothing. The waste from
cotton mills, consisting for the most part
of &#8220;piece ends,&#8221; imperfect beginnings or
endings, which must be torn off when the
piece is made up, are exactly suitable for
carpet weaving; and, in fact, if made for
the purpose could hardly be better. These
can be bought for from ten to twelve cents
per pound. The same price holds for
ginghams and for coloured cottons of
various sorts.</p>

<p>Cutting from shirt-making and clothing
establishments are not as good. In shirt
cuttings the cloth varies a good deal in
thickness, and, in addition to this disadvantage,
cannot be torn into strips, many
of the pieces being bias, and therefore having
to be cut. It is true that while this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
entails additional use of time in preparation,
bias rags are a more elastic filling
than straight ones, and if uniformly and
carefully cut and sewed a rug made from
them is worth more and will probably sell
for more than one made of straight rags.</p>

<p>Shirt cuttings sell for about three cents
per pound, and while a proportion of them
are too small for use and would have to be
re-sold for paper rags, the cost of material
for cotton rugs would still be very trifling.
Suitable woolen rags from the mills sell for
twenty-five cents per pound. Tailors&#8217; and
dressmakers&#8217; cuttings are much cheaper,
and very advantageous arrangements can
be made with large establishments if one
is prepared to take all they have to offer.</p>

<p>One difficulty with woolen rags from
tailoring establishments is in the sombreness
of the colours; but much can be done
by judicious sorting and sewing of the rags,
for it is astonishing how bits of every conceivable
colour will melt together when
brought into a mixed mass; also if they
are woven upon a red warp the effect is
brightened.</p>

<p>Having secured materials of different
kinds, the next step is in the cutting and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
sewing, and here also new methods must
step in.</p>

<p>The old-fashioned way of sewing carpet
rags&mdash;that is, simply <i>tacking</i> them together
with a large needle and coarse thread&mdash;will
not answer at all in this new development
of rug making. The filling must be
smooth, without lumps or rag ends, and
the joinings absolutely fast and fairly inconspicuous.
Some of the new rags from
cotton or woolen mills come in pieces from
a quarter to a half-yard in length and the
usual width of the cloth. These can be
sewed together on the sewing machine,
lapping and basting them before sewing.
They should lap from a quarter to a half
inch and have two sewings, one at either
edge of the lap. If sewed in this way they
can afterward be torn into strips, using the
scissors to cut across seams. It can be
performed very speedily when one is
accustomed to it, and is absolutely secure,
so that no rag ends can ever be seen in
the finished weaving.</p>

<p>If the cloth pieces which are to be used
for rags are not wide enough to sew on the
sewing machine, they should be lapped and
sewed by hand in the same way, unless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
they happen to have selvedge ends, in
which case they should by all means be
strongly overhanded. This makes the
best possible joining, as it is no thicker
than the rest of the rag filling, and consequently
gives an even surface. Good sewing
is the first step toward making good
and workmanlike rugs.</p>

<p>Whenever the rags can be torn instead
of cut, it is preferable, as it secures uniform
width. The width, of course, must vary according
to the quality of cloth and weight
desired in the rug. A certain weight is
necessary to make it lie smoothly, as a
light rug will not stay in place on the floor.
In ordinary cotton cloth an inch wide<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
strip is not too heavy and will pinch into
the required space. If, however, a door-hanging
or lounge-cover is being woven,
the rags may be made half that width.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>



<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></h2>

<h3>THE PATTERN.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap"><big>W</big>hen</span> proper warp and filling are secured,
experimental weaving may begin.
If the loom is an old-fashioned wooden one,
it will weave only in yard widths, and this
yard width takes four hundred and fifty
threads of warp. Warping the loom is
really the only difficult or troublesome
part of plain weaving, and therefore it is
best to put in as long a warp as one is
likely to use in one colour. One and a
half pounds of cotton rags will make one
yard of weaving.</p>

<p>The simplest trial will be the weaving
of white filling, either old or new, with a
warp of medium indigo blue. Of course
each warp must be long enough to weave
several rugs; and the first one, to make
the experiment as simple as possible,
should be of white rags alone upon a blue
warp. There must be an allowance of five
inches of warp for fringe before the weaving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
is begun, and ten inches at the end
of the rug to make a fringe for both first
and second rugs. Sometimes the warp is
set in groups of three, with a corresponding
interval between, and this&mdash;if the
tension is firm and the rags soft&mdash;gives
a sort of honeycomb effect which is very
good.</p>

<p>The grouping of the warp is especially
desirable in one-coloured rugs, as it gives
a variation of surface which is really
attractive.</p>

<p>When woven, the rug should measure
three feet by six, without the fringe. This
is to be knotted, allowing six threads to a
knot. This kind of bath-rug&mdash;which is
the simplest thing possible in weaving&mdash;will
be found to be truly valuable, both
for use and effect. If the filling is sufficiently
heavy, and especially if it is made
of half-worn rags, it will be soft to the feet,
and can be as easily washed as a white
counterpane; in fact, it can be thrown on
the grass in a heavy shower and allowed
to wash and bleach itself.</p>

<p>Several variations can be made upon
this blue warp in the way of borders and
color-splashes by using any indigo-dyed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
material mixed with the white rags. Cheap
blue ginghams, &#8220;domestics&#8221; or half-worn
and somewhat faded blue denims will be
of the right depth of color, but as a rule
new denim is of too dark a blue to introduce
with pure white filling.</p>

<p>The illustration called &#8220;The Onteora
Rug&#8221; is made by using a proportion of a
half-pound of blue rags to the two and a
half of white required to make up the three
pounds of cotton filling required in a six-foot
rug. This half-pound of blue should
be distributed through the rug in three
portions, and the two and a half pounds
of white also into three, so as to insure an
equal share of blue to every third of the
rug. After this division is made it is quite
immaterial how it goes together. The
blue rags may be long, short or medium,
and the effect is almost certain to be
equally good.</p>

<p>The side border in &#8220;The Lois Rug,&#8221;
which is made upon the same blue warp, is
separately woven, and afterward added to
the plain white rug with blue ends, but an
irregular side border can easily be made
by sewing the rags in lengths of a half-yard,
alternating the blue and white, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
keeping the white rags in the centre of the
rug while weaving.</p>

<p>These three or four variations of style
in what we may call washable rugs are
almost equally good where red warp is
used, substituting Turkey red rags with
the white filling instead of blue. An orange
warp can be used for an orange and white
rug, mixing the white filling with ordinary
orange cotton cloth.</p>

<p>The effect may be reversed by using a
white warp with a red, blue or yellow
filling, making the borders and splashes
with white. One of the best experiments
in plain weaving I have seen is a red rug
of the &#8220;Lois&#8221; style, using white warp and
mixed white and green gingham rags for
the borders, while the body of the rug is
in shaded red rags.</p>

<p>This, however, brings us to the question
of color in fillings, which must be treated
separately.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<a name="onteora" id="onteora"></a></p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/illo003.jpg"><img src="images/illo003_th.jpg"
alt="The Onteora Rug" title="The Onteora Rug" /></a></p>

<p class="caption">THE ONTEORA RUG</p>

<p>Of course, variations of all kinds can be
made in washable rugs. Light and dark
blue rags can be used in large proportion
with white ones to make a &#8220;hit or miss,&#8221;
and where a darker rug is considered better
for household use it can be made entirely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
of dark and light blue on a white warp;
the same thing can be done in reds, yellows
and greens. Brown can be used with
good effect mixed with orange, using
orange warp; or orange, green and brown
will make a good combination on a white
warp. In almost every variety of rug
except where blue warp is used a red stripe
in the border will be found an improvement.</p>

<p>A very close, evenly distributed red
warp, with white filling, will make a pink
rug good enough and pretty enough for
the daintiest bedroom. If it is begun and
finished with a half-inch of the same warp
used as filling, it makes a sort of border;
and this, with the red fringe, completes
what every one will acknowledge is an exceptionally
good piece of floor furnishing.</p>

<p>In using woolen rags, which are apt to
be much darker in colour than cotton, a
white, red or yellow warp is more apt to
be effective than either a green or a blue;
in fact, it is quite safe to say that light
filling should go with dark warp and dark
filling with light or white.</p>

<p>There is an extremely good style of rag
rug made at Isle Lamotte, in Vermont,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
where very dark blue or green woolen rags
are woven upon a white warp, with a design
of arrows in white at regular intervals
at the sides. This design is made by
turning back the filling at a given point
and introducing a piece of white filling,
which in turn is turned back when the
length needed for the design is woven and
another dark one introduced, each one to
be turned back at the necessary place
and taken up in the next row. Of course,
while the design is in progress one must
use several pieces of filling in each row of
weaving.</p>

<p>The black border can only be made by
introducing a large number of short pieces
of the contrasting colour which is to be used
in the design and tacking them in place as
the weaving proceeds. Of course, in this
case thin cloth should be used for the
colour-blocks, as otherwise the doubling of
texture would make an uneven surface.
If the rug is a woolen one, not liable to be
washed, this variation of color in pattern
can be cleverly made by brushing the applied
color pieces lightly with <i>glue</i>. Of
course, in this case the design will show
only on the upper side of the rug. In fact,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the only way to make the design show
equally on both sides is by turning back
the warp, as in the arrow design, or by
actually cutting out and sewing in pieces
of colour.</p>

<p>By following out the device of using
glue for fastening the bits of colour which
make border designs many new and very
interesting effects can be obtained, as most
block and angle forms can be produced
by lines made in weaving. It is only where
the rug must be constantly subject to
washing that they are not desirable. It
must be remembered that the warp threads
bind them into place, after they are glue-fastened.</p>

<p>Large rugs for centres of rooms can be
made of woolen rags by weaving a separate
narrow border for the two sides. If the
first piece is three feet wide by eight in
length, and a foot-wide border is added at
the sides, it will make a rug five feet wide
by eight feet long; or if two eight-foot
lengths are sewn together, with a foot-wide
border, it will make an eight-by-eight
centre rug. The border should be of black
or very dark coloured filling. In making
a bordered rug, two dark ends must be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
woven on the central length of the rug&mdash;that
is, one foot of black or dark rags can
be woven on each end and six feet of the
&#8220;hit or miss&#8221; effect in the middle. This
gives a strip of eight feet long, including
two dark ends. The separate narrow
width, one foot wide and sixteen feet in
length, must be added to this, eight feet
on either side. The border must be very
strongly sewn in order to give the same
strength as in the rest of the rug.</p>

<p>The same plan can be carried out in
larger rugs, by sewing breadths together
and adding a border, but they are not
easily lifted, and are apt to pull apart by
their own weight. Still, the fact remains
that very excellent and handsome rugs can
be made from rags, in any size required to
cover the floor of a room, by sewing the
breadths and adding borders, and if care
and taste are used in the combinations as
good an effect can be secured as in a much
more costly flooring.</p>

<p>The ultimate success of all these different
methods of weaving rag rugs depends
upon the amount of beauty that can be
put into them. They possess all the necessary
qualities of durability, usefulness and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
inexpensiveness, but if they cannot be
made beautiful other estimable qualities
will not secure the wide popularity they
deserve. Durable and beautiful colour
will always make them salable, and good
colour is easily attainable if the value of
it is understood.</p>

<p>There are two ways of compassing this
necessity. One is to buy, if possible, in
piece ends and mill waste, such materials
as Turkey red, blue and green ginghams,
and blue domestics and denims, as well as
all the dark colours which come in tailors&#8217;
cuttings. The other and better alternative
is to buy the waste of white cotton
mills and dye it. For the best class of
rugs&mdash;those which include beauty as well
as usefulness, and which will consequently
bring a much larger price if sold&mdash;it is quite
worth while to buy cheap muslins and
calicoes; and as quality&mdash;that is, coarseness
or fineness&mdash;is perfectly immaterial, it
is possible to buy them at from four to five
cents per yard. These goods can be torn
lengthwise, which saves nearly the whole
labor of sewing them, and from eight to
ten yards, according to their fineness, will
make a yard of weaving. The best textile<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
for this is undoubtedly unbleached muslin,
even approaching the quality called
&#8220;cheesecloth.&#8221; This can easily be dyed
if one wishes dark instead of light colours,
and it makes a light, strong, elastic rug
which is very satisfactory.</p>

<p>In rag carpet weaving in homesteads
and farmhouses&mdash;and it is so truly a domestic
art that it is to be hoped this kind
of weaving will be confined principally to
them&mdash;some one of the household should
be skilled in simple dyeing. This is very important,
as better and cheaper rugs can be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
made if the weaver can get what she wants
in colour by having it dyed in the house,
rather than by the chance of finding it
among the rags she buys.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<h3>DYEING.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap"><big>I</big>n</span> the early years of the past century a
dye-tub was as much a necessity in every
house as a spinning wheel, and the re-establishment
of it in houses where weaving
is practised is almost a necessity; in
fact, it would be of far greater use at present
than in the days when it was only used
to dye the wool needed for the family knitting
and weaving. All shades of blue,
from sky-blue to blue-black, can be dyed
in the indigo-tub; and it has the merit of
being a cheap as well as an almost perfectly
fast dye. It could be used for dyeing
warps as well as fillings, and I have
before spoken of the difficulty, indeed almost
impossibility, of procuring indigo-dyed
carpet yarn.</p>

<p>Blue is perhaps more universally useful
than any other colour in rag rug making,
since it is safe for both cotton and wool,
and covers a range from the white rug with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
blue warp, the blue rug with white warp,
through all varieties of shade to the dark
blue, or clouded blue, or green rug,
upon white warp. It can also be used in
connection with yellow or orange, or with
copperas or walnut dye, in different shades
of green; and, in short, unless one has exceptional
advantages in buying rags from
woolen mills, I can hardly imagine a profitable
industry of rag-weaving established
in any farmhouse without the existence of
an indigo dyeing-tub.</p>


<h4>RED.</h4>

<p>The next important color is red. Red
warps can be bought, but the lighter shades
are not even reasonably fast; and indeed,
the only sure way of securing absolutely
fast colour in cotton warp is to dye it.
Prepared dyes are somewhat expensive
on account of the quantity required, but
there are two colours, Turkey red and
cardinal red, which are extremely good for
the purpose. These can be brought at
wholesale from dealers in chemicals and
dye-stuffs at much cheaper rates than by
the small paper from the druggist.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>


<h4>COPPERAS.</h4>

<p>The ordinary copperas, which can be
bought at any country store, gives a fast
nankeen-coloured dye, and this is very
useful in making a dull green by an after-dip
in the indigo-tub.</p>


<h4>WALNUT.</h4>

<p>There are some valuable domestic dyes
which are within the reach of every
country dweller, the best and cheapest of
which is walnut or butternut stain. This
is made by steeping the bark of the tree or
the shell of the nut until the water is dark
with colour. It will give various shades
of yellow, brown, dark brown and green
brown, according to the strength of the
decoction or the state of the bark or nut
when used. If the bark of the nut is used
when green, the result will be a yellow
brown; and this stain is also valuable in
making a green tint when an after-dip of
blue is added. Leaves and tree-bark will
give a brown with a very green tint, and
these different shades used in different rags
woven together give a very agreeably
clouded effect. Walnut stain will itself set
or fasten some others; for instance, pokeberry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
stain, which is a lovely crimson, can
be made reasonably fast by setting it with
walnut juice.</p>


<h4>RUST-COLOUR.</h4>

<p>Iron rust is the most indelible of all
stains besides being a most agreeable
yellow, and it is not hard to obtain, as bits
of old iron left standing in water will soon
manufacture it. It would be a good use
for old tin saucepans and various other
house utensils which have come to a state
of mischievousness instead of usefulness.</p>


<h4>GRAY.</h4>

<p>Ink gives various shades of gray according
to its strength, but it would be cheaper
to purchase it in the form of logwood than
as ink.</p>


<h4>LOGWOOD CHIPS.</h4>

<p>Logwood chips boiled in water give a
good yellow brown&mdash;deep in proportion to
the strength of the decoction.</p>


<h4>YELLOW FROM FUSTIC.</h4>

<p>Yellow from fustic requires to be set
with alum, and this is more effectively
done if the material to be dyed is soaked in
alum water and dried previous to dyeing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Seven ounces of alum to two quarts of
water is the proper proportion. The
fustic chips should be well soaked, and
afterward boiled for a half-hour to extract
the dye, which will be a strong and fast
yellow.</p>


<h4>ORANGE.</h4>

<p>Orange is generally the product of
annato, which must be dissolved with
water to which a lump of washing soda has
been added. The material must be soaked
in a solution of tin crystals before dipping,
if a pure orange is desired, as without this
the color will be a pink buff&mdash;or &#8220;nankeen&#8221;
color.</p>

<p>What I have written on the subject of
home dyeing is intended more in the way
of suggestion than direction, as it is simply
giving some results of my own experiments,
based upon early familiarity with
natural growths rather than scientific
knowledge. I have found the experiments
most interesting, and more than
fairly successful, and I can imagine nothing
more fascinating than a persistent search
for natural and permanent dyes.</p>

<p>The Irish homespun friezes, which are
so dependable in colour for out-of-door<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
wear, are invariably dyed with natural
stains, procured from heather roots,
mosses, and bog plants of like nature. It
must be remembered that any permanent
or indelible stain is a dye, and if boys
and girls who live in the country were set
to look for plants possessing the colour-quality,
many new ones might be discovered.
I am told by a Kentucky mountain
woman, used to the production of
reliable colour in her excellent weaving,
that the ordinary roadside smartweed
gives one of the best of yellows. Indeed,
she showed me a blanket with a yellow
border which had been in use for twenty
years, and still held a beautiful lemon
yellow. In preparing this, the plant is
steeped in water, and the tint set with
alum. Combining this with indigo, or by
an after-dip in indigo-water, one could
procure various shades of fast blue-green,
a colour which is hard to get, because most
yellows, which should be one of its preparatory
tints, are buff instead of lemon
yellow.</p>

<p>An unlimited supply and large variety
of cheap and reliable colour in rag filling,
and a few strong and brilliant colours in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
warps, are conditions for success in rag
rug weaving, but these colours must be
studiously and carefully combined to produce
the best results.</p>

<p>I have said that, as a rule, light warps
must go with dark filling and dark warps
with light, and I will add a few general
rules which I have found advantageous in
my weaving.</p>

<p>In the first place, in rugs which are
largely of one colour, as blue, or green, or
red, or yellow, no effort should be made to
secure <i>even</i> dyeing; in fact, the more uneven
the colour is the better will be the rug.
Dark and light and spotted colour work
into a shaded effect which is very attractive.
The most successful of the simple
rugs I possess is of a cardinal red woven
upon a white warp. It was chiefly made
of white rags treated with cardinal red
Diamond dye, and was purposely made as
uneven as possible. The border consists
of two four-inch strips of &#8220;hit or miss&#8221;
green, white and red mixed rags, placed
four inches from either end, with an inch
stripe of red between, and the whole finished
with a white knotted fringe.</p>

<p>A safe and general rule is that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
border stripes should be of the same
colour as the warp&mdash;as, for instance, with
a red warp a red striped border&mdash;while the
centre and ends of the rug might be mixed
rags of all descriptions.</p>

<p>It is also safe to say that in using pure
white or pure black in mixed rags, these
two colours, and particularly the white,
should appear in short pieces, as otherwise
they give a striped instead of a mottled
effect, and this is objectionable. White is
valuable for strong effects or lines in
design; indeed, it is hard to make design
prominent or effective except in white or
red.</p>

alt="The Lois Rug" title="The Lois Rug" /></a></p>

<p class="caption">THE LOIS RUG</p>

<p>These few general rules as to colour,
together with the particular ones given in
other chapters, produce agreeable combinations
in very simple and easy fashion.
I have not, perhaps, laid as much stress
upon warp grouping and treatment as is
desirable, since quite distinct effects are
produced by these things. Throwing the
warp into groups of three or four threads,
leaving small spaces between, produces a
sort of basket-work style; while simply
doubling the warp and holding it with
firm tension gives the honeycomb effect of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
which I have previously spoken. If the
filling is wide and soft, and well pushed
back between each throw of the shuttle,
it will bunch up between the warp threads
like a string of beads, and in a dark warp
and light filling a rim of coloured shadow
seems to show around each little prominence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Such rugs are more elastic to the
tread than an even-threaded one, and on
the whole may be considered a very desirable
variation.</p>

<p>It is well for the weaver to remember<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
that every successful experiment puts the
manufacture on a higher plane of development
and makes it more valuable as a
family industry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<h3>INGRAIN CARPET RUGS.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap"><big>U</big>ndoubtedly</span> the most useful&mdash;and
from a utilitarian point of view the most
perfect&mdash;rag rug is made from worn ingrain
carpet, especially if it is of the honest
all-wool kind, and not the modern mixture
of cotton and wool. There are places in
the textile world where a mixture of cotton
and wool is highly advantageous, but in
ingrain carpeting, where the sympathetic
fibre of the wool holds fast to its adopted
colour, and the less tenacious cotton allows
it to drift easily away, the result is a rusty
grayness of colour which shames the whole
fabric. This grayness of aspect cannot be
overcome in the carpet except by re-dyeing,
and even then the improvement may
be transitory, so an experienced maker of
rugs lets the half-cotton ingrain drift to
its end without hope of resurrection.</p>

<p>The cutting of old ingrain into strips for
weaving is not so serious a task as it would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
seem. Where there is an out-of-doors to
work in, the breadths can easily be torn
apart without inconvenience from dust.
After this they should be placed, one at
a time, in an old-fashioned &#8220;pounding-barrel&#8221;
and invited to part with every
particle of dust which they have accumulated
from the foot of man.</p>

<p>For those who do not know the virtues
and functions of the &#8220;pounding-barrel,&#8221;
I must explain that it is an ordinary, tight,
hard-wood barrel; the virtue lying in the
pounder, which may be a broom-handle,
or, what is still better, the smooth old oak
or ash handle of a discarded rake or hoe.
At the end of it is a firmly fixed block of
wood, which can be brought down with
vigour upon rough and soiled textiles. It
is an effective separator of dust and fibre,
and is, in fact, a New England improvement
upon the stone-pounding process
which one sees along the shores of streams
and lakes in nearly all countries but England
and America.</p>

<p>If the pounding-barrel is lacking, the
next best thing is&mdash;after a vigorous shaking&mdash;to
leave the breadths spread upon
the grass, subject to the visitations of wind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
and rain. After a few days of such exposure
they will be quite ready to handle
without offense. Then comes the process
of cutting. The selvages must be sheared
as narrowly as possible, since every inch
of the carpet is valuable. When the selvages
are removed, the breadths are to be
cut into long strips of nearly an inch in
width and rolled into balls for the loom.
If the pieces are four or five yards in
length, only two or three need to be sewn
together until the weaving is actually
begun, as the balls would otherwise become
too heavy to handle. As the work proceeds,
however, the joinings must be well
lapped and strongly sewn, the rising of
one of the ends in the woven piece being
a very apparent blemish.</p>

<p>Rugs made of carpeting require a much
stronger warp than do ordinary cotton or
woolen rugs, and therefore a twine made
of flax or hemp, if it be of fast colour, will
be found very serviceable. Some weavers
fringe the rags by pulling out side threads,
and this gives an effect of <i>nap</i> to the
woven rug which is very effective, for as
the rag is doubled in weaving the raveled
ends of threads stand up on the surface,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
making quite a furry appearance. I have
a rug treated in this way made from old
green carpeting, woven with a red warp,
which presents so rich an appearance that
it might easily be mistaken for a far more
costly one. It has, however, the weak
point of having been woven with the ordinary
light-red warp of commerce, and is
therefore sure to lose colour. If the warp
had been re-dyed by the weaver, with
&#8220;Turkey red,&#8221; it would probably have
held colour as long as it held together.</p>

<p>This cutting of ingrain rags would seem
to be a serious task, but where weaving is
a business instead of an amusement it is
quite worth while to buy a &#8220;cutting table&#8221;
upon which the carpet is stretched and
cut with a knife. This table, with its machinery,
can be bought wherever looms
and loom supplies are kept, at a cost of
from seven to eight dollars. If the strips
are raveled at all, it should be at least for
a third of an inch, as otherwise the rug
would possess simply a rough and not a
napped surface. If the strips are cut
an inch in width and raveled rather more
than a third on each side, it still leaves
enough cloth to hold firmly in the weaving,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
but I have known one industrious soul who
raveled the strips until only a narrow
third was left down the middle of the strip,
and this she found it necessary to stitch
with the sewing machine to prevent further
raveling. I have also known of the
experiment of cutting the strips on the
bias, stitching along the centre and pulling
the two edges until they were completely
ruffled. Although this is a painstaking
process, it has very tangible merits, as,
in the first place, absolutely nothing of
the carpet is wasted&mdash;no threads are pulled
out and thrown away as in the other
method&mdash;and in the next the sewings
together are overhand instead of lapped.
The raveled waste can often be used as
filling for the ends of rugs if it is wound as
it is pulled from the carpet rags. Indeed,
one can hardly afford to waste such good
material.</p>

<p>It will be seen that there are great possibilities
in the carpet rug. Even the unravelled
ones are desirable floor covering
on account of their weight and firmness.
They lie where they are placed, with no
turned-up ends, and this is a great virtue
in rugs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course much of the beauty of the ingrain
carpet rug depends upon the original
colour of the carpet. Most of those which
are without design will work well into rugs
if a strongly contrasting colour is used in
the warp. If, for instance, the carpet
colour is plain blue, the warp should be
white; if yellow, either an orange warp,
which will make a very bright rug, or a
green warp, which will give a soft yellowish
green, or a blue, which will give a general
effect of green changing to yellow.</p>

<p>If the carpet should be a figured one,
a red warp will be found more effective
than any other in bringing all the colours
together. If it should happen to be faded
or colourless, the breadths can be dipped
in a tub of strong dye of some colour which
will act well upon the previous tint. If,
for instance, it should be a faded blue,
it may be dipped in an indigo dye for
renewal of colour, or into yellow, which will
change it into green. A poor yellow will
take a brilliant red dye, and a faded brown
or fawn will be changed into a good claret
colour by treating it with red dye. Faded
brown or fawn colours will take a good
dark green, as will also a weak blue. Blue<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
can also be treated with yellow or a fresher
blue.</p>

<p>Of course, in speaking of this kind of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
dyeing, the renewal of old tints, it is with
reference to the common prepared dyes
which are for sale&mdash;with directions&mdash;by
every druggist, and with a little knowledge
of how these colours act upon each other
one can produce very good effects. It is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
quite a different thing from the dyeing of
fibre which is to be woven into cloth. In
the latter case it is far wiser to use vegetable
dyes, but in the freshening of old
material the prepared mineral dyes are
more convenient and sufficiently effective.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>



<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></h2>

<h3>WOVEN RAG PORTIERES.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap"><big>R</big>ag</span> weaving is not necessarily confined
to rugs, for very beautiful portieres and
table and lounge covers may be woven
from carefully chosen and prepared rags.
The process is practically the same, the
difference being like that between coarse
and fine needlework, where finer material
and closer and more painstaking handiwork
is bestowed. The result is like a
homespun cloth. Both warp and woof
must be finer than in ordinary carpet
weaving. Instead of coarse cotton yarn,
warp must be fine &#8220;mercerized&#8221; cotton, or
of linen or silk thread, and the warp
threads are set much closer in the loom.
In place of ten or twelve threads to the
inch, there should be from fifteen to
twenty. The woof or filling may be old
or new, and either of fine cotton, merino,
serge, or other wool material, or of silk.
The ordinary &#8220;silk-rag portiere&#8221; is not a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
very attractive hanging, being somewhat
akin to the crazy quilt, and made, as is that
bewildering production, from a collection
of ribbons and silk pieces of all colours and
qualities, cut and sewed together in a haphazard
way, without any arrangement of
colour or thought of effect, and sent to the
weaver with a vague idea of getting something
of worth from valueless material.
This is quite a different thing from a silk
portiere made from some beautiful old
silk garment, which is too much worn for
further use, where warp and woof colour
are selected for fitness and harmony, and
the weaver uses her rags, as the painter
does his colours, with a purpose of artistic
effect. If the work is done from that point
of view, the last state of the once beautiful
old garment may truly be said to be better
than the first. If a light cloth is used for
this kind of manufacture, it may be torn
into strips so narrow as to simulate yarn&mdash;and
make what appears to be yarn weaving.
This cannot well be done with old
or worn cloth, because there is not strength
in the very narrow strip to bear the strain
of tearing; but new muslin, almost as light
as that which is known as &#8220;cheesecloth,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>&#8221;
treated in this way makes a beautiful
canvas-like weaving which, if well coloured,
is very attractive for portieres or table
covers.</p>

<p>If one has breadths of silk of a quality
which can be torn without raveling, and
is sufficiently strong to bear the process, it
is delightful material to work with. If it
is of ordinary thickness, a half-inch in
width is quite wide enough, and this will
roll or double into the size of ordinary
yarn. If the silk is not strong enough to
tear, it is better to cut the strips upon the
bias than straight, and the same is true of
fine woolens, like merinos, cashmeres, or
any worsted goods. There is much more
elasticity in them when cut in this way,
and they are more readily crushed together
by the warp.</p>

<p>I know a beautiful hanging of crimson
silk, or rather of crimson and garnet&mdash;the
crimson having been originally a light silk
dress dyed to shade into the garnet. The
two coloured rags were sewn together
&#8220;hit or miss&#8221; fashion and woven upon a
bright cardinal-coloured warp. There
was no attempt at border: it was simply a
length of vari-coloured coarse silk weaving,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
absolutely precious for colour and
quality.</p>

<p>Treated in this way, an old silk gown
takes on quite a new value and becomes
invested with absorbing interest. Spots
and tarnish disappear in the metempsychosis,
or serve for scattered variation,
and if the weaver chooses to still further
embellish it with a monogram or design in
cross stitch embroidery, she has acquired
a piece of drapery which might be a valuable
inheritance to her children.</p>

<p>Merino or cashmere which has been
worn and washed, and is coupled with
other material of harmonizing colour, like
pieces of silk or velvet, is almost as valuable
for the making of portieres and table
covers as if it were silk. Indeed, for the
latter purpose it is preferable, being generally
washable.</p>

<p>Cotton hangings made in this way are
often very desirable. &#8220;Summer muslins&#8221;
which have served their time as dresses,
and are of beautiful colour and quite strong
enough to go into the loom, can be woven
with a warp of gray linen thread into really
beautiful hangings, especially the strong,
plain tints&mdash;the blues and greens and reds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
which have been so much worn of late
years. They have the advantage of being
easily washable, and are particularly suitable
for country-house hangings. Even
worn sheets and pillow-cases can be dyed
to suit the furnishing of different rooms,
and woven with a silk warp of stronger
colour. They should be torn into strips
not more than a third of an inch wide, so
that it may crush into a roll not larger
than an ordinary yarn. This will weave
into a light, strong cloth, always interesting
because it differs from anything which
can be purchased through ordinary channels.
To reappear in the shape of a beautiful
and valuable rag-weaving is the final
resurrection of good textiles, when they
have performed their duty in the world
and been worn out in its service.</p>

<p>These home-woven portieres are better
without borders, the whole surface being
plain or simply clouded by mixing two
tints of the same colour together. They
can be elaborated by adding a hand-made
fringe of folds of cloth sewn into a lattice
and finished with tassels. This is quite a
decorative feature, and particularly suitable
to the weaving.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>It can easily be understood that a large
share of the beauty of making these household
furnishings lies in the colour. If that
is good the rug or portiere or table-cover
is beautiful. If it is either dull or glaring,
the pleasure one might have in it is lacking,
and it is quite within one&#8217;s power to have
the article always beautiful.</p>

<p>It must also be remembered, if weaving
is taken up as a source of profit, that <i>few
things which do not please the eye will sell</i>.
Therefore, if for no other reason, it is
well worth while for the weaver to first
study the choice, production and combination
of beautiful colours rather than the
fabric of the rug.</p>

<p>I have said, and will reiterate, that for
this particular kind of manufacture&mdash;the
restoration and adaptation of old goods,
and the strengthening of tints in carpet
warps&mdash;the yellows and reds of the
Magic or Diamond dyes of commerce are
effective and reliable. Indeed, for new
goods cardinal dye is all that could be
asked, but when it comes to the use
of dyes for the weaving of textiles and
artistic fabrics, one must resort to dye
woods and plants.</p>

<h4>FRINGES.</h4>

<p>Nothing is more important than the
proper <i>finish</i> of the rug, and this generally
consists in a careful going over of the work
after it has come from the loom&mdash;the cutting
of stray ravelings and sewing of loose
ends, and the knotting of the long warp
ends.</p>

<p>It is only a very careless or inexperienced
weaver who leaves the warp ends in the
state in which they come from the loom;
and indeed they can be made one of the
most effective features of the rug. Simple
knotting of every six threads will make
them safe from raveling, and sometimes
the shortness of the warp ends allows no
more than this. It is well worth while,
however, to leave six or eight inches to
work into decorative fringes, and these
can be made in various ways, of which illustrations
are given.</p>

<p>In the case of decorative fringes there
can be double or triple knotting&mdash;straight,
or worked into points; braided fringes
which have the merit of both strength and
beauty, and are free from the tangle-trouble
of long fringes, and the very effective
rag-lattice finish for portieres and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
table-covers. Indeed, half the beauty of
the rug may lie in the fringing and finish.</p>


<h4>PROFITS.</h4>

<p>The pecuniary gain from rag rug weaving
may easily be calculated. First of all
comes the cost of the loom, which will be
about seventy dollars. The interest upon
this, with necessary repairs, may be reckoned
at about five dollars per year.</p>

<p>To every six-foot rug goes two-thirds of
a pound of warp, and this would amount
to from ten-and-a-half to fourteen cents,
according to the rate of purchase. To
every such rug must go three pounds of
cotton or two pounds of woolen rags, costing
for cotton thirty and for woolen
fifty cents. To the cotton rugs must be
added the possible cost of dye-stuffs,
which, again, might cost twenty cents,
making cost of material in either cotton
or woolen rugs from sixty to sixty-four
cents.</p>

<p>As far as profit is concerned, if rag
rugs are well made they will sell for two
dollars each, if successful in colour, from
two dollars and a half to three and a half,
and if beautiful and exceptional in colour
and finish from four to six dollars. But it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
must be remembered that this latter price
will be for rugs which have artistic value.
Probably the average weaver can safely
reckon upon one dollar and eighty-five
cents to two dollars regular profit for the
labor of sewing and filling and weaving
and knotting the rugs. It is fair to accept
this as a basis for regular profit, the amount
of which must depend upon facility of
production and the ability to produce unexceptionable
things.</p>

<p>But it is not alone pecuniary gain which
should be considered. Ability to produce
or create a good thing is in itself a happiness,
and the value of happiness cannot
easily be reckoned. The knowledge necessary
to such production is a personal gain.
Everything we can do which people generally
cannot or do not do, or which we
can do better than others, helps us to a
certain value of ourselves which makes
life valuable. For this reason, then, as
well as for the gain of it, a loom in the
house and a knowledge of weaving is an
advantage, not only for the elders, but to
the children. If the boys and girls in
every farmhouse were taught to create
more things, they would not only be abler<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
as human beings, but they would not be so
ready to run out into the world in search
of interesting occupations. A loom, a
turning-lathe, a work-bench, and a chest
of tools, a house-organ or melodeon, and
a neighbourhood library, would keep boys
and girls at home, and make them more
valuable citizens when independent living
became a necessity. Everything which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
broadens the life, which must by reason
of narrow means and fixed occupation
be stationary, gives something of the advantage
of travel and contact with the
world, and the adding of profitable outside
industries to farmhouse life is an important
step in this direction.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>



<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></h2>

<h3>WOOLEN RUGS.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap"><big>T</big>here</span> are two conditions which will
make home weaving valuable. The first
is that the material, whether it be of
cotton or wool, should be grown upon the
farm, and that it could not be sold in the
raw state at a price which would make the
growing of it profitable. In wool crops
there are certain odds and ends of ragged,
stained and torn locks, which would injure
the appearance of the fleece, and are therefore
thrown aside, and this waste is perfectly
suitable for rug weaving.</p>

<p>In cotton there is not the amount of
waste, but the fibre itself is not as valuable,
and a portion of it could be reserved
for home weaving, even though it should
not be turned to more profitable account.</p>

<p>The next condition is that the time used
in weaving is also waste or left-over time.
If housekeeping requires only a quarter or
half of a woman&#8217;s time, weaving is more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
restful and interesting, as well as more
profitable, than idleness; and in almost
every family there are members to whom
partial employment would be a boon.</p>

<p>There is no marketable value for spare
time or for individual taste, so that the
women of the family possessing these can
start a weaving enterprise, counting only
the cost of material at growers&#8217; prices. If
they can card, spin, dye and weave as well
as the women of two generations did before
them, they have a most profitable industry
in their own hands in the shape of weaving.</p>

<p>If materials must be purchased the
profit is smaller, and the question arises
whether spare time and personal taste and
skill can be made profitable. This depends
entirely upon circumstances and
character. When circumstances are or
can be made favourable, and there is industry
and ambition behind them, domestic
weaving is a beautiful and profitable
occupation.</p>

<p>There are many neighbourhoods where
the conditions are exactly suitable to the
prosecution of important domestic industries&mdash;localities
where sheep are raised<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
and wool is a regular product, or where
cotton is grown and the weaving habit is
not extinct. This is true of many New
England neighbourhoods and of the whole
Cumberland Mountain region, and it is in
response to a demand for direction of
unapplied advantages that this book is
written.</p>

<p>I am convinced that the weaving of
domestic wool or cotton rugs might be
so developed in the mountain regions of
the South as to greatly decrease the
importation of Eastern ones of the same
grade.</p>

<p>An endless variety might be made in
these localities, the difference of climate,
material and habits of thought adding interest
as well as variety, and it is safe to
say that the home market is waiting for
them. Housekeepers have learned by
experience that a rug which can be easily
lifted and frequently shaken is not only far
more cleanly, and consequently safer, from
a sanitary point of view, than a carpet, but
that it has other merits which are of
economic as well as esthetic importance.</p>

<p>A rug is more durable than a carpet of
equal weight and texture because it can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
be constantly shifted from points of wear
to those which are less exposed. It can be
moved from room to room, or even from
house to house, without the trouble of
shaping or fitting; and last but not least,
it brings a concentration of colour exactly
where it is needed for effect, and this is
possible to no other piece of house furnishing.
In short, there seems to be no bar to
its general acceptance, excepting the bad
floors of our immediate predecessors in
building.</p>

<p>It only needs that cost, quality and general
effect of the home-woven rugs should
be shaped into perfect adaptation to our
wants, to make them as necessary a part
of ordinary house-furnishing as chairs
and tables.</p>

<p>These three requirements are within the
reach of any home-weaving farmer&#8217;s wife
who will give to the work the same thought
for economical conditions, the same ambition
for thorough work and the same
intelligent study which her husband bestows
upon his successful farming.</p>

<p>As there is already one American rug
which fulfills most of these conditions, it
is well to consider it as a starting point for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
progress. This is the heavy Indian rug
known as the Navajo blanket. Originally
fashioned to withstand the cold and exposure
of outdoor life, it has combined
thickness, durability and softness with
excellent colour and weaving and perfectly
characteristic design.</p>

<p>In the best examples, where the wool is
not bought from traders, but carded, spun
and dyed by the weaver, the Navajo
blanket is a perfect production of its kind,
and I cannot help wondering that the manufacture
of these rug-like blankets&mdash;some
of which are of great intrinsic value&mdash;should
have been so long confined to a
primitive race, living at our very doors.
The whole process of spinning, dyeing and
weaving could be carried on in any farmhouse,
using the coarsest and least valuable
wool, and by reliable and well-chosen
colour, good weight and careful weaving
bringing the manufacture into a prominent
place among the home productions of our
people.</p>

<p>One can hardly imagine simpler machinery
than is used by the Indians. It
is scarcely more than a parallelogram of
sticks, supported by a back brace, and yet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
upon these simple looms an Indian woman
will weave a fabric that will actually hold
water.</p>

<p>The clumsy, old-fashioned loom which
is still in use in many farmhouses is fully
equal to all demands of this variety of
weaving, but there are already in the
market steel-frame looms with fly shuttles
which take up much less room and are
more easily worked. I was about to say
they were capable of better work, but
nothing could be better in method than
the Indian rug, woven on its three upright
sticks; and after all it is well to remember
that <i>quality is in the weaver</i>, and not in the
loom. The results obtained from the
simplest machinery can be made to cover
ground which is truly artistic.</p>

<p>As an example of what may be done to
make this kind of weaving available, we
will suppose that some one having an ordinary
loom, and in the habit of weaving rag
carpet, wishes to experiment toward the
production of a good yarn rug. The first
thing required would, of course, be material
for both warp and woof.</p>

<p>The warp can be made of strong cotton
yarn which is manufactured for this very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
purpose and can be bought for about
seventeen cents a pound. This is probably
cheaper than it could be carded and spun
at home even on a cotton-growing farm.</p>

<p>The wool filling should be coarse and
slack-twisted, and on wool-growing farms
or in wool-growing districts is easily produced.
If it is of home manufacture, it
may be spun as loosely or slackly as possible,
dyed and woven without doubling,
which will be seen to be an economy of
labor. The single thread, slackly twisted,
gives a very desirable elasticity to the
fabric, because the wool fibre is not too
closely bound or packed. On the other
hand, if the wool as well as the warp must
be bought, it is best to get it from the spinning
machine in its first state of the single
thread, and do the doubling and twisting
at home. In this case it can be doubled
as many or as few times as it is thought
best, and twisted as little as possible.</p>

<p>The next and most important thing is
colour, and it is a great advantage if the
dyeing can be done at home. There is a
strong and well-founded preference among
art producers in favor of vegetable dyes,
and yet it is possible to use certain of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
aniline colours, especially in combination,
in safe and satisfactory ways.</p>

<p>Every one who undertakes domestic
weaving must know how to dye one or two
good colours&mdash;black, of course, and the
half-black or gray which a good colourist
of my acquaintance calls <i>light black</i>; indigo
blue equally, of course, in three shades of
very dark, medium and light; and red in
two shades of dark and light. Here are
seven shades from the three dyes, and when
we add white we see that the weaver is
already very well equipped with a variety
of colour. The eight shades can be still
further enlarged by clouding and mixing.
The mixing can be done in two ways, either
by carding two tints together before spinning,
or by twisting them together when
spun.</p>

<p>Carding together gives a very much
better effect in wool, while twisting together
is preferable in cotton.</p>

<p>Dark blue and white or medium blue
and white wool carded together will give
two blue-grays, which cannot be obtained
by dyeing, and are most valuable. White
and red carded together give a lovely pink,
and any shade of gray can be made by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
carding different proportions of black and
white or half-black and white. A valuable
gray is made by carding black and
white wool together (and by black wool I
mean the natural black or brownish wool
of black sheep). Mixing of deeply dyed
and white wool together in carding is,
artistically considered, a very valuable
process, as it gives a softness of colour
which it is impossible to get in any other
way. Clouding&mdash;which is almost an indispensable
process for rug centres&mdash;can be
done by winding certain portions of the
skeins or hanks of yarn very tightly and
closely with twine before they are thrown
into the dye-pot. The winding must be
close enough to prevent the dye penetrating
to the yarn. This means, of course,
when the clouding is to be of white and
another colour. If it is to be of two shades
of one colour, as a light and medium blue,
the skein is first dyed a light blue, and
after drying is wound as I have described,
and thrown again into the dye-pot, until
the unwound portions become the darker
blue which we call medium.</p>

<p>In a neighbourhood where weaving is a
general industry, it is an advantage if some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
one person who has a general aptitude for
dyeing and experiments in colours undertakes
it as a business. This is on the principle
that a person who does only one
thing does it with more facility and better
than one who works in various lines. Yet
even when there is a neighbourhood dyer,
it is, as I have said, almost indispensable
that the weaver should know how to dye
one or two colours and to do it well.</p>

<p>Supposing that the material, in the shape
of coarse cotton warp, black, red or white,
has been secured, or that a wool filling in
the colours and shades I have described
has been prepared for weaving; the loom is
then to be warped, at the rate of fifteen or
less threads to the inch, according to the
coarseness or fineness of the filling.</p>

<p>It is well to weave a half-inch of the
cotton warp for filling, as this binds the
ends more firmly than wool. Next to this,
a border of black and gray in alternate
half-inch stripes can be woven, and following
that, the body of the rug in dark
red, clouded with white. After five feet
of the red is woven, a border end of the
black and gray is added, and the rug may
be cut from the loom, leaving about four<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
inches of the warp at either end as a fringe.
If the filling yarn is of good colour, and has
been well packed in the weaving, <i>so as to
entirely cover the warp</i>, the result will be a
good, attractive and durable woolen rug,
woven after the Navajo method.</p>

<p>In this one example I have given the
bare and simple outline by following
which a weaver whose previous work has
been only rag carpet weaving can manufacture
a good and valuable wool rug. The
difference will be simply that of close warping
and a substitution of wool for rags.
Its value will be considerably increased
or lessened by the choice of material both
in quality and colour and the closeness
and perfection of weaving.</p>

<p>The example given calls for a rug six
feet long by three feet in width. To make
this very rug a much more important one,
it needs only to vary the size of the border.
For a larger rug the length must be increased
two feet, and the border, which in
this case must be of plain or mixed black&mdash;that
is, it must not be alternated with
stripes of gray&mdash;must measure one foot at
either end. When this is complete, two
narrow strips one foot in width, woven<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
with mixed black filling, must be sewed
on either side, making a rug eight feet long
and five in width. It is not a disadvantage
to have this border strip sewn, instead of
being woven as a part of the centre. Many
of the cheaper Oriental weavings are put
together in this way, and as many of the
older house-looms will only weave a three-foot
width, it is well to know that that
need not prevent the production of rugs of
considerable size.</p>

<p>Endless variations of this very simple
yarn rug can be made with variation in
size as well as in colour. Two breadths and
two borders, the breadths three feet in
width and the borders one foot and six
inches, will give a breadth of nine feet,
which with a corresponding length will
give a rug which will sufficiently cover the
floor of an ordinary room. If the centre is
skilfully mottled and shaded, it will make
a floor spread of beautiful colour, and one
which could hardly be found in shops.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<a name="isle" id="isle"></a></p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/illo007.jpg"><img src="images/illo007_th.jpg"
alt="ISLE LA MOTTE RUG" title="ISLE LA MOTTE RUG" /></a></p>

<p class="caption">ISLE LA MOTTE RUG</p>

<p>The border can be made brighter, as well
as firmer and stiffer, by using two filling
threads together&mdash;a red and a black; or
an alternate use of red and black, using
two shuttles, will give a lighter and better<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
effect than when black is used exclusively.</p>

<p>After size and weight&mdash;or, to speak
comprehensively, <i>quality</i>&mdash;is secured in
this kind of simple weaving, the next
most important thing is colour. Of
course the colour must be absolutely
fast, but I have shown how much
variety can be made by shading and
mixing of three fast colours, and much
more subtle and artistic effects can be produced
by weaving alternate threads of different
colours. Indeed, the effects obtained
by using alternate threads can be
varied to almost any extent; as, for instance,
a blue and yellow thread&mdash;provided
the blue is no deeper than the
yellow&mdash;will give the effect of green to the
eye. If the blue is stronger or deeper, as
it will almost necessarily be, it will be
modified and softened into a greenish blue.</p>

<p>Red and white woven in alternate
threads upon a white warp will give an
effect of pink, and with this colour for a
centre the border should be a good gray.</p>

<p>Of course, alternate throwing of different
coloured yarns makes the weaving
go more slowly than when one alone is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
used, and something of the same colour
effect can be produced by doubling, instead
of alternating. It is, of course, not quite
the same, as one colour may show either
under or over the other, and the effect is
apt to be mottled instead of one of uniform
stripes.</p>

<p>The end in view in all these mixtures is
<i>variation</i> and liveliness of colour, not an
effect of stripes or spots; indeed, these are
very objectionable, especially when in contrasted
or different colors. A deepening
or lightening of the same colour in irregular
patches, as will occur in clouded yarns,
gives interest, whereas if these cloudings
were in strongly contrasted colours they
would be crude and unrestful. For this
reason, if for no other, it is well to work in
few tints, and use contrasting colours only
for borders.</p>

<p>To show how much variety is possible in
weaving with the few dyes I have named,
I will give a number of combinations which
will produce good results and be apt to
harmonize with ordinary furnishing. By
adding orange yellow, which is also one of
the simplest and safest of dyes, we secure
by mixture with blue a mottled green, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
this completes a range of colour which
really leaves nothing to be desired.</p>

<p>No. 15. Border of doubled threads of
dark blue and orange. Centre of alternate
stripes of inch wide light blue and orange
woven together, one-half inch stripes of
clear orange and white woven together.</p>

<p>In the examples I have given, wherever
doubled threads of different colours woven
together are used, it must be understood
that they are to be slightly twisted, and
that the warping for double-filling rugs
need not be as close as for single filling.
Twelve threads to the inch would be better
than fifteen, and perhaps ten or eleven
would be still better. Doubled yarn of
different colours produces a mottled or
broken effect, and this can often be done<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
where the colours of the yarns do not quite
satisfy the weaver. If they are too dull,
twisting them slackly with a very brilliant
tint will give a better shade than if the
original tint was satisfactory, but in the
same way yarns which are too brilliant
can often be made soft and effective by
twisting them together with a paler tint.
Minute particles of colour brought together
in this way are brilliant without
crudeness. It is, in fact, the very principle
upon which impressionist painters
work, giving pure colour instead of mixed,
but in such minute and broken bits that the
eye confounds them with surrounding
colour, getting at the same time the double
impression of softness and vivacity.</p>

<p>These examples of fifteen different rugs
which can be woven from the three tints
of blue, red and orange, together with
black and white, do not by any means<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
exhaust the possibilities of variety which
can be obtained from three tints. Each
rug will give a suggestion for the next, and
each may be an improvement upon its
predecessor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<h3>COTTON RUGS.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap"><big>T</big>he</span> warp-covered weaving which I
have described in a previous chapter as
being the simplest and best method for
woolen rugs, is equally applicable to cotton
weaving. It is, in fact, the one used in
making the cotton rugs woven in prisons
in India, and which in consequence are
known as &#8220;prison rugs.&#8221; They are generally
woven in stripes of dark and light
shades of indigo blue and measure about
four by eight feet. They are greatly used
by English residents in India, being much
better adapted to life in a hot climate than
the more costly Indian and Persian rugs,
which supply the world-demand for floor
coverings.</p>

<p>In our own summer climate and chintz-furnished
summer cottages they would be
an extremely appropriate and economical
covering for floors. The warp is like that
of the Navajo blanket, a heavy cotton<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
cord, the filling or woof of many doubled
fine cotton threads, which quite cover the
heavy warp, and give the ridged effect of
a coarse <i>rep</i>.</p>

<p>As I have said, they are woven almost
invariably in horizontal stripes of two
blues, or blue and white, with darker ends
and a warp fringe. Simple as they are
and indeed must be, as they are the result
of unskilled labour, they are pleasant to
look at, and have many virtues not dependent
upon looks. They are warm and
pleasant to unshod feet, and therefore suitable
for bedroom use. They are soft to
shoe tread, and give colour and comfort to
a summer piazza. They can be hung as
portieres in draughty places with a certainty
of shelter, and can be lifted and
thrown upon the grass to be washed by the
downpour of a thunder shower, and left to
dry in the sun without detriment to colour
or quality.</p>

<p>Surely this is a goodly list of virtues,
and the sum of them is by no means exhausted.
Their durability is surprising;
and they can be sewn together and
stretched upon large floors with excellent
colour effect. They can be turned or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
moved from room to room and place to
place with a facility which makes them
more than useful. The manufacture is so
simple that a child might weave them,
while at the same time, by a skilful use of
colour and good arrangement of border,
they can be made to fit the needs of the
most luxurious as well as the simplest
summer cottage. In short, they are capable
of infinite variation and improvement,
without departure from the simple method
of the &#8220;prison rug.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course the variation must be in
colour and the arrangement of colour;
and in studying this possible improvement
it must be remembered that cotton
will neither take nor hold dyes as readily as
wool or silk, and that certain dyes which
are very tenacious in their hold upon
animal fibre cannot be depended upon
when applied to vegetable fibre. There
are, however, certain dyes upon which we
can safely rely. Indigo blue, and the red
used in dyeing what is called Turkey red,
are reliable in application to both wool
and cotton, and are water and sun proof
as well. Walnut and butternut stains
will give fast shades of brown and yellow,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
and in addition there is also the buff or
nankeen-coloured cotton, the natural tint
of which combines well with brown and
blue.</p>

<p>In giving directions for rug colourings
in cottons, I shall confine myself to the
use of black, white, blue and red, because
these colours are easily procurable, and
also because rugs manufactured from
them will fit the style of furnishing which
demands cotton rugs.</p>

<p>The examples I shall give call for graduated
dyeing, especially in the two tints of
red and blue.</p>

<p>Any one expecting to succeed in rug
weaving must be able to procure or produce
from two to three planes of colour,
as well as two mixtures in each. These
would be as follows:</p>

<p>In blue:&mdash;1st, dark blue; 2d, medium
blue; 3d, light blue.</p>

<p>After these three tints are secure, three
variations of blue can be made by knotting
the skeins more or less closely and throwing
medium, light blue and white together
into the dye-tub. Here they must remain
until the white skeins show an outside
of light blue; the light blue skeins are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
apparently changed to medium, and the
medium to dark. When they are untied
and dried they will show three clouded
mixtures:</p>

<p>1st, the medium blue clouded with dark;
2d, light blue clouded with medium blue;
3d, white, clouded with light blue.</p>

<p>Here we have six variations of the one
tint. Red can be treated in the same way,
except that a rather light and a very dark
red are all that can be counted upon safely
as plain tints. A very light red will not
hold. Therefore we have in reds:&mdash;1st,
dark red; 2d, light red; 3d, light red,
clouded with dark; 4th, white, clouded
with light red.</p>

<p>This gives ten shades in these two tints,
and when we add the variations which
seem to come of themselves in dyeing,
variations which are by no means subject
to rule, we shall see that with these two,
and black and white, we are very well
equipped.</p>

<p>The more irregular the clouding, the
better the results. The yarn may be
made into large double knots, or small
single ones, or into more or less tightly
wound balls or bundles, and each will have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
its own special and peculiar effect. Perhaps
it is well to say that in clouding upon
white the colours should be kept as light
as is consistent with the tenacity of tint.</p>

<p>After clouding, still another process in
cotton mixtures is possible, and this is in
&#8220;doubling and twisting,&#8221; which has the
effect of darkening or lightening any tint
at will, as well as of giving a mottled
instead of a plain surface.</p>

<p>Having secured variety by these various
expedients, the next step is to make
harmonious and well-balanced combinations,
and this is quite as important, or
even more so, as mere variety.</p>

<p>There is one very simple and useful rule
in colour arrangements, and this is to
make one tint largely predominant. If it
is to be a blue rug, or a pink, or a white
one, use other colours only to <i>emphasize</i>
the predominant one, as, for instance, a
blue rug may be emphasized by a border
of red and black; or a red rug by a border of
black and white, or black and yellow.</p>

<p>The border should always be stronger&mdash;that
is darker or deeper in colour&mdash;than the
centre, even when the same colour is used
throughout, as in a light red rug, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
dark, almost claret-red ends, or a medium
blue rug with very dark blue ends.</p>

<p>White, however, can often be used in
borders of rather dark rugs in alternation
with black or any dark colour, because its
total absence of tint makes it strong and
distinct, and gives it <i>force</i> in marking a
limit.</p>

<p>One successful combination of colours
will suggest others, and the weaver who
has taken pains to provide herself with
a variety of shades, and will follow the
rules of proportion, will be at no loss in
laying out the plan of her weavings.</p>

<p>The examples for fifteen weavings given
in the paper on wool rugs are equally
available in cotton. I will, however, add
a few variations especially adapted for
cotton rugs:</p>

<p>No. 1. <i>Colours blue and white.</i> Border
six inches of plain dark blue. Six inches
of alternate half-inch stripes of dark blue
and white. Four to five feet of clouded
blue, border repeated, with four inches of
warp fringe as a finish.</p>

<p>No. 2. <i>Colours blue and white.</i> Border
eight inches wide of plain medium blue.
Centre, six feet of light blue, clouded with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
medium. Two side borders eight inches
wide; finish of white warp fringe.</p>

<p>No. 3. <i>Colours black, white and red.</i>
Border twelve inches of alternate half-inch
stripes of black and white. Centre, four
feet of light red, clouded with dark. Repeat
border, and finish with warp fringe.</p>

<p>No. 4. <i>Colours red and white.</i> Border,
twelve inches of dark and light red, in
twisted double thread. Centre, light red
and white twisted double thread. Repeat
border and finish with four-inch fringe.</p>

<p>No. 5. <i>Colours butternut-brown, walnut-yellow,
red, and white.</i> Border of six inches
of brown and yellow, twisted together.
Centre, five feet of light red and white,
twisted together. Repeat border, and
finish with fringe.</p>

<p>No. 6. <i>Colours brown, blue, and clouded-white.</i>
Border, half-inch stripes of medium
blue and brown alternated for six
inches. Centre, five feet of light blue,
clouded with medium. Repeat border
and finish with warp fringe.</p>

<p>These six examples may be varied to any
extent by the use of clouded, plain or
mixed centres. Borders, as a rule, should
be woven of unclouded colours.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>A natural development of the cotton
rug would be the weaving of coarse cotton
yarns into piece lengths which could be cut
and sewn like ingrain carpet, or like the
fine cotton-warped mattings which have
been so popular of late years. They would
have the advantage over grass-weavings
in durability, ease of handling and liveliness
of effect. Indeed, the latter consideration
is of great importance, as cotton carpets
can be woven to harmonize with the
chintzes and cottons which are so much
used in summer furnishings. This is especially
true of indigo-blue floor covering,
since so few things are absolutely perfect
as an adjunct to the blue chambrays,
striped awning-cloths, denims, and India
prints so constantly and effectively used
in draperies. Indeed, such excellent art
in design has been devoted to blue prints,
both foreign and domestic, that one can
safely reckon upon their prolonged use,
and this being taken for granted, it is well
to extend the weaving of mixtures of white
and blue indefinitely.</p>

<p>Although the warp-covered method described
for woolen and cotton rug weaving
can very well be used for carpets, the still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
simpler one of the alternate thread, or
basket-weaving, when warp and filling are
of equal weight and size, can be made to
answer the purpose quite as well. In fact,
there is a certain advantage in the latter
method, since it makes the warp a factor
in the arrangement of colour.</p>

<p>It is necessary in this style of weaving
that the filling should be a hand-twisted
thread of the same weight and size as the
warp, and of a lighter or darker shade of
the same colour. If the warp is dark,
the filling may be light, or the reverse.
It should be warped at the rate of about
twenty-four threads to the inch.</p>

<p>In this kind of weaving the colours must
be plain&mdash;that is, unclouded&mdash;as the variation
is obtained by the different shades of
warp and filling. Still another variation
is made by using a closer warp of thirty
threads to the inch and a large soft vari-colour
filling which will show between the
warp threads with a peculiar watered or
vibratory effect. A light red warp, with
a very loosely twisted filling of black and
white, or a medium blue warp with a black
and orange filling, will give extremely
good results.</p>

<p>What I have said thus far as to the
weaving of woolen and cotton rugs, and
of cotton carpets, gives practical directions
for artistic results to women who understand
the use of the loom in very simple
weaving. Of course, more difficult things
can be done even with ordinary looms, as
any one who has examined the elaborate
blue-and-white spreads our grandmothers
wove upon the cumbrous house-loom of
that period can testify. In fact, the degree
of skill required in the weaving of these
precious heirlooms would be quite sufficient
for the production of rugs adapted
to very exacting purchasers.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is as well to add that the
directions given in this and the preceding
chapter for rug weaving are designed not
only or exclusively for weavers, but also for
club women who are so situated as to have
access to and influence in farming or weaving
neighbourhoods.</p>

<p>Home manufactures, guided by women
of culture and means, would have the advantage
not only of refinement of taste,
but of a certainty of aim. Women know
what women like, and as they are the final
purchasers of all household furnishings,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
they are not apt to encourage the making
of things for which there is no demand.</p>

<p>I am often asked the question, How are
all of these homespun and home-woven
things to be disposed of? To this I answer
that the first effort of the promoters
or originators must be&mdash;<i>to fit them for an
existing demand</i>.</p>

<p>There is no doubt of the genuineness of
a demand for special domestic weavings.
Any neighbourhood or combination of
women known to be able to furnish such
articles to the public would find the want
far in excess of the supply, simply because
undirected or commercial manufactures
cannot fit personal wants as perfectly as
special things can do. It must be remembered,
also, that the interchange of news<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
between bodies of women interested in industrial
art will be a very potent factor
in the creation of a market for any
domestic specialty. In fact, it is in
response to a demand that these articles
upon home-weavings have been prepared,
and a demand for technical instruction
presupposes an interest in the result.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<h3>LINSEY WOOLSEY.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap"><big>I</big>t</span> has often been given as a reason for
the discontinuance of home weaving, that
no product of the hand loom can be as
exact or as cheap as that of the power
loom. The statement as to cost and
quality is true, but so far from being
a discouraging one, it gives actual reasons
for the continuance of domestic weavings.
The very fact that homespun textiles are
not exact&mdash;in the sense of absolute sameness&mdash;and
not cheap, in the sense of first
cost, is apt to be a reason for buying them.
Hand-weaving, like handwriting, is individual,
and this is a virtue instead of a
defect, since it gives the variety which
satisfies some mystery of human liking, a
preference for inequality rather than
monotonous excellence.</p>

<p>Every hand-woven web differs from
every other one in certain characteristics
which are stamped upon it by the weaver,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
and we value these differences. In fact,
this very trace of human individuality
is the initial charm belonging to all art
industries, and even if we discount this
advantage, and reckon only money cost
and money value, durability must certainly
count for something. A thing
which costs more and lasts longer is as
cheap as one which costs less and goes
to pieces before its proper time.</p>

<p>In a long and intimate acquaintance
with what are called &#8220;art textiles&#8221;&mdash;that
is, textiles which satisfy the eye and the
imagination and fulfill more or less competently
the function of use, I have learned
that certain very desirable qualities are
more often found in home-woven than
in machine-woven goods. Something is
wanting in each of the excellent and wonderful
variety of commercial manufactures
which would fit it for the various decorative
and art processes which modern life
demands. To perfectly satisfy this demand,
we should have a weaving which is
not only in itself an artistic manufacture,
but which easily absorbs any additional
application of art.</p>

<p>In my own mind I call the thing which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
might and does not exist, The Missing
Textile. To make it entirely appropriate
to our esthetic and practical needs, the
missing textile must be strong enough for
every-day wear and use; it must be capable
of soft, round folds in hanging; and have
the quality of elasticity which will prevent
creasing; and above all, it must have beautiful
and lasting colour. If it can add to
these qualities an adaptability to various
household uses, it will achieve success and
deserve it. These different qualities, and
especially the one of a natural affinity for
such art-processes as colour and embroidery,
exist in none of our domestic weavings,
excepting only linsey woolsey. After
much study of this virtuous product of the
mountain regions of our Southern States
I find it capable of great development.
It has two qualities which are not often
co-existent, and these are strength and
flexibility; and this is owing not only to
its being hand-woven, but also to its being
a wool-filled textile&mdash;that is, it is woven
upon a cotton warp, with a single twisted
wool-filling. This peculiarity of texture
makes it very suitable for embroidery,
since it offers little resistance to the needle,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
and yet is firm enough to prevent stitches
sinking into its substance&mdash;a frequent
fault with soft or loosely woven textiles.
The warp is generally made of what the
weavers call mill yarns, cotton yarns spun
and often dyed in cotton mills; and when
the cloth is woven for women&#8217;s wear
it is apt to carry a striped warp of red and
blue, with a mixed filling made from spinning
the wool of black sheep with a small
proportion of white.</p>

<p>In searching for art textiles, one would
not find much encouragement in this particular
variety of linsey woolsey, but the
unbleached, uncoloured material which is
woven for all kinds of household use, or
piece-dyed for men&#8217;s wear, is quite a different
thing. In its undyed state it is of a
warm ivory tint, which makes a beautiful
ground for printing, and in my first
acquaintance with it, which was made
through the women commissioners from
Kentucky, Tennessee and Georgia during
the Columbian Exposition, I made some
most interesting experiments in block
printing upon this natural background.</p>

<p>One can hardly expect that linsey woolsey
will come into frequent or common use<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
as a printed textile, since the two processes
of hand-weaving and block-printing
are not natural neighbours, but this
capacity for taking and holding stains is of
great value in embroidery, since it enables
an artistic embroiderer to produce excellent
effects with comparatively little
labour. A clever needlewoman, working
upon a fabric which takes kindly to stains,
can apply colour in many large spaces and
inter-spaces in her design which would
otherwise have to be covered with stitchery,
and in this way&mdash;which is a perfectly
accepted and legitimate one&mdash;she gains an
effect which would otherwise be costly and
laborious.</p>

<p>From the composite nature of this domestic
fabric, its cross-weaving of animal
and vegetable fibre, it takes colour irregularly.
Every cross-thread of wool is
deeper in tone than the cotton thread it
crosses, and this gives the quality which
artists call vivacity or vibration. Linsey
woolsey even when &#8220;piece-dyed&#8221; has
something of this effect, and judicious and
artistic colour treatment would complete
its claims to be considered an art textile.</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that the weavers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
themselves can work out this problem. It
will need the direction and encouragement
of educated and artistic women. Taking
the fabric just as it exists, it is ready for the
finer domestic processes learned by the
women of the South during the hard years
of the Civil War. The clever expedients
of stitchery, the ways in which they varied
their simple home-manufactures, and
above all the knowledge gained of domestic
&#8220;colouring,&#8221; will be of inestimable value
in the direction of artistic industries. In
truth, Southern women have ways of
staining and dyeing and producing beautiful
colour quite unknown to other American
women. They know how to get different
grays and purples and black from
logwood, and golden and dark brown from
walnut bark, and all the shades of blue
possible to indigo; and yellow-reds from
madder, and rose-red and crimson from
pokeberry, and one yellow from pumpkin
and another from goldenrod; and they are
clever enough to find mordants for all these
dyes and stains, and make them indelible.
It needs exactly the conjunction which we
find in the South, of facile home-weaving,
knowledge and practice of experimental<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
dyeing, and love of practical art, to develop
true art fabrics.</p>

<p>To show what linsey woolsey is capable
of, I will instance a material woven in
India in thin woolen strips of about twelve
inches in width. It is what we should call
a <i>sleazy</i> material to begin with. The strips
of different colours are sewn, and very badly
sewn, together, and they are also badly
woven. Too flimsy for actual wear, they
are simply admirable vehicles for colour,
and to this quality alone they owe their
popularity and importance. After being
sewn together, the strips are generally
embroidered in a rough way, with a constantly
repeating figure on each breadth.
The colour is certainly beautiful, a contrast
of soft blues, and a selection of unapproachable
browns&mdash;yellow-browns, red-browns,
green-browns and gold-browns,
with yellows of all shades, and whites
of all tints, and this colour-beauty gives
them a place as portieres and curtains
where they do not belong by intrinsic or
constitutional worth.</p>

<p>If one was intent only upon producing
an imitation of the Bagdad curtains in
linsey woolsey, it would be easy to weave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
narrow lengths of various colours, and by
choosing those which were good contrasts
or harmonies, and embroidering them
together with buttonhole-stitch, or cat-stitch,
or any ornamental stitch, to get
something very like them in effect and
far better in quality. But it should be the
aim of domestic manufacture to do something
which is <i>distinctive</i>, and therefore it
would be better to start with the intention
of producing the effect in one&#8217;s own way.
This could be done by weaving the cloth
in full width (which should, if possible, be
four feet), depending entirely upon the
warp threads for colour. This, it may be
remembered, is already one of the means of
variation applied to linsey woolsey in
weaving homespun dress goods; but in this
case it must be carefully chosen art-effort,
using colours which are in themselves beautiful.
In depending upon the warp alone
for colour the fact must be kept in mind
that it will be much obscured by the over-weaving
of the wool filling. It will be
necessary, therefore, to use far stronger
colours than if they were to stand unmixed
or unobscured. Vivid blue, strong orange,
flaming red and gold-brown could be used<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
in the warp in stripes of about ten inches
in width, with two inches of dead black
on the sides and between each colour.
The filling must be of one pale tint, either
an ivory white or lemon yellow, or a very
pale spring green woven over all. This
would modify the violence of colour, giving
an effect like hoar frost over autumn
leaves. As a simple weaving this would
have a beautiful effect, but when a coarse
orange-coloured silk embroidery, consisting
of a waved stem and alternate leaves,
is carried down the centre of each black
stripe, the simple length of linsey woolsey
is transformed into what would be called
a very Eastern-looking and valuable embroidery.</p>

<p>This is just one of its possible and easily
possible adaptations for portieres and
hangings. Quite another and perhaps
equally popular one would be cross-colour
upon a tinted warp. In this case the warp
might be ivory white, yellow, light green,
or even for darker effects, claret red, dark
blue, dark green, or black. If an ivory
white or light warp colour should be
chosen, the cross-colours must be selected
with special reference to the warp tint.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
A beautiful effect for a light room would
be made on an ivory-coloured warp by
weaving at the top and also below the
middle a series of narrow stripes like a
Roman scarf. There should be a finger&#8217;s
depth of rose colour at the top, and this
would be obtained by a filling of light red,
woven upon the ivory white warp. Then
should come an inch stripe of pale blue,
an inch of gold, another inch of blue; three
inches of orange, then the inch of blue,
the gold, and the blue again, and after
that the rose-red for two-thirds the length
of the portiere, when the ribbon stripes
should again occur, after which the remaining
third should be woven with a
deeper red or a pale green.</p>

<p>Such a portiere would not require embroidery
to complete its effect, for if the
tints were pure as well as delicate, it would
be a lovely piece of colour in itself.</p>

<p>This variety or style of hanging would
have the advantage of throwing the burden
of colour upon the wool, and as the
animal fibre is apt to be more tenacious in
its hold upon colour than vegetable, the
question of fading would not have to be
considered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>These two varieties of artistic homespun
can by experiment be made to cover a
great deal that is beautiful and artistic in
manufacture, and yet it leaves untouched
the extensive field of plain piece-dyed or
yarn-dyed weavings. Yarn-dyed material
always has the advantage of the possible
use of two colours, one in the warp and one
in the filling, but in certain places, as in
upholstery, a solid colour produced by
piece-dyeing would be preferable. Linsey
woolsey dyed in fast and attractive
colour would undoubtedly be a good material
for upholstery of simple furniture,
because of its strength and durability, but
it seems to me its chief mission and probable
future is to supply an exceptional
art textile; one which has the firmness and
flexibility belonging to hand-woven stuffs,
and can be at the same time beautiful in
colour, capable of hard wear and reasonably
inexpensive. I am tempted to modify
the last qualification, because no hand-woven
goods ought to be or can be inexpensive,
in comparison with those manufactured
under every condition of competitive
economy. And in truth, domestic
weavings are sure of their market at paying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
prices, simply because they are what they
are, <i>hand products</i>.</p>

<p>I have shown in a limited way some of
the possibilities of artistic hand-weaving
without touching upon cotton or flax
diapers and damasks, since these cannot
readily compete with power-weavings,
but I have not spoken of the difference it
would make in the lives of the mountain
weavers of the South if their horizon could
be widened by the introduction of art industries.
Only those who know the joy
and compensation of producing things of
beauty can realize the change it might
work in lives which have been for generations
narrowed to merely physical wants;
but there are many gifted Southern women
who do fully realize it, and we may safely
leave to them the introduction and encouragement
of art in domestic manufactures.</p>

<h3>AFTER-WORD</h3>


<p><span class="smcap"><big>I</big> am</span> often asked by women who are interested
in domestic manufactures, how
one should go to work to build up a profitable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
neighbourhood industry. To do this
one must know the place and people,
for anxious as most country women are
to earn something outside of farm profits,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
they are both timid and cautious, and
will not follow advice from unpractical
people or from strangers.</p>

<p>In every farming community there will
be one or two ingenious or ambitious
women who do something which is not
general, and which they would gladly turn
to account. One woman may be a skilled
knitter of tidies, or laces, or rag mats;
another may pull rags through burlap, and
so construct a thick and rather luxurious-looking
door-mat; another may have an
old-fashioned loom and weave carpets for
all the neighbourhood; and each one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
these simple arts is a foundation upon
which an industry may be built, important
to the neighbourhood, and in the aggregate
to the country.</p>

<p>The city woman or club woman who
wishes to become a link between these
things and a purchaser must begin by improving
or adapting them. She must
show the knitter of tidies an imported golf
stocking with all of the latest stitches and
stripes and fads, and if the yarn can be had,
undoubtedly the tidy-knitter can make
exactly such another. When a good pair
has been produced, the city friend will not
have to look far among her town acquaintances
for a &#8220;golf fiend,&#8221; even if she herself
is not one, and to him or her she must
show the stocking and expatiate upon its
merits: That it is not machine-made, but
hand-knit; that it is thicker, softer, made
of better material than woven ones, and
above all, not to be found in any shop,
but must be ordered from a particular
woman who is a phenomenal knitter. All
of which will be true, and equally so when
the demand has increased and it has become
a neighbourhood industry.</p>

<p>A golf player hardly need be told how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
to create a demand for hand-knit stockings,
or how to assist the knitter by advice,
both in the improvement and disposal of
her wares; but it should be a veritable golf
player and not a philanthropic amateur.</p>

<p>It is the same with other industries.
The adviser must study them, improve
them, adapt them, and find the first
market, after which they will sell upon
their own merits.</p>

<p>As far as I know, nothing has been done
in the way of improvement of knitted
mats or rugs, although a very beautiful
manufacture has been founded upon the
method of pulling rags through burlap.
Knitted rugs have much to recommend
them. They can be made of all sorts of
pieces, even the smallest; they wear well,
and can easily be made beautiful.</p>

<p>The building up of a rag carpet or rag
rug industry is a much simpler matter, because
the demand exists everywhere for
cheap, durable and well-coloured floor
covering. In my own experience I have
found that the thing chiefly necessary is
to teach the weavers that the colour must
be pleasing and permanent, and to put
them in communication with sources of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
supply of rags and warp. The rugs sell
themselves, and probably will continue to
do so.</p>

<p>The thing to remember when one wishes
to be of use to their own and other communities,
is that they must be sure of a
commercial basis for the products before
they encourage more than one person to
begin a manufacture, and that the demand
must be in advance of a full supply.
Kindly and cultivated women who wish
to be of real use to their summer neighbours
will find this a true mission. Their
lives lie within the current of demand,
while the country woman lives within
that of supply, and it is much easier for
the city woman to bridge the space between
than for her working neighbour.
All good and well-founded industries take
care of themselves in time, but until the
merchant finds them out, and interposes
the wedge of personal profit between things
and their market&mdash;inciting and encouraging
both&mdash;it seems to be the business of
women in every lot of life to help each
other.</p>
